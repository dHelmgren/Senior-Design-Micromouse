						Right sensor to R side of base: 8.94mm
						Left sensor to L side of base: 19.60mm
						Right sensor angle to R side of base (0 degrees): 42.306 degrees
												  = 0.521108126 radians
						Left sensor angle to L side of base (180 degrees): 31.488 degrees
												  = 0.738379251 radians
						Straight sensor to top of base: -3.00mm
